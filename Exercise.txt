Task Management System

Description:

Create a simple task management system using PHP. The system should allow users to add, edit, delete, and view tasks. Each task should have a title, description, and status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," or "Completed").

Requirements:

    Task Listing:
        Display a list of tasks on the homepage.
        Each task should show its title, description, and status.
        Tasks should be sorted by status (e.g., "To Do" tasks first, then "In Progress," and finally "Completed").

    Add Task:
        Include a form that allows users to add a new task.
        The form should have fields for title, description, and status.
        When a user submits the form, the task should be added to the list.

    Edit Task:
        Allow users to edit existing tasks.
        Provide an edit button for each task that opens a form with pre-filled task details.
        Users can update the task's title, description, and status.

    Delete Task:
        Allow users to delete tasks.
        Provide a delete button for each task that removes the task from the list.

    Task Status Change:
        Allow users to change the status of a task (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress").
        Provide a dropdown or radio buttons to select the new status.

Additional Features (Optional):

    Task Validation:
        Implement validation for task fields (e.g., required fields, maximum length).

    Database Integration:
        Store tasks in a MySQL database for persistence.
        Modify the PHP code to interact with the database for CRUD operations.

    User Authentication:
        Implement user authentication so that only authenticated users can add, edit, or delete tasks.

Instructions:

    Set up a PHP development environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or a web server with PHP support).

    Create the necessary PHP files (e.g., index.php, add.php, edit.php, delete.php).

    Design a user-friendly interface for your task management system using HTML and CSS.

    Write PHP code to implement the functionality described in the requirements.

    Test your task management system by adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

    Optionally, integrate a database for data persistence or implement user authentication.

    Provide clear instructions for how to use your task management system.

This project will help you practice PHP programming, HTML/CSS for the user interface, and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. You can also extend this project by adding more features and improving the user experience.
